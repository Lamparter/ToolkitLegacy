# ‚ú® New Repository ‚ú®

‚ùó We moved development to [a new repository, 'Windows'](https://aka.ms/toolkit/windows). It contains the new infrastructure and codebase for the 8.0+ versions of the Windows Community Toolkit that contains a single-codebase for [UWP/WinUI2](https://aka.ms/winui2), [WindowsAppSDK/WinUI3](https://aka.ms/winui3), and [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno) compatible components. _Please visit it for the latest information._

üìù You can find out more about this latest release [on our blog post here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/announcing-windows-community-toolkit-v8-0/). The Sample Gallery has also been [updated in the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp).

üß™ For new feature discussion and development, see [Windows Community Toolkit Labs](https://aka.ms/toolkit/labs/windows)

üêû For new issues, please try and reproduce on the latest packages, and then open a discussion or issue in the [new repository](https://aka.ms/toolkit/windows).

üìº This repo contains the prior 7.x UWP-only based code for the Windows Community Toolkit's prior releases; the Windows App SDK compatible code is in the [`winui` branch](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/tree/winui). Much of this code has been merged and ported to the single-codebase version in the new repository; however, this repo will be archived for history and reference to enable migrating other components or issues, if needed.

## üß∞ Windows Community Toolkit 7.x

The Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer patterns when building experiences for Windows 10 and Windows 11. It contains components and helpers for both UWP and WinUI 3/WinAppSDK applications. Find out more about our support for [WinUI 3 here](https://aka.ms/wct-winui3).

**Note**: Our general helpers for .NET are now the [.NET Community Toolkit](https://aka.ms/toolkit/dotnet), including the [MVVM Toolkit](https://aka.ms/mvvmtoolkit).

## üì¢ Windows Community Toolkit v8

The toolkit has been migrated to new infrastructure in [this repository](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Windows).
